# Ocquarium Privacy Policy

Ocquarium is an *open-source* application (the **SERVICE**) built by Timothy
**"ZeevoX"** Langer (referred to hereafter as the **DEVELOPER**), re-using
source code from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). This SERVICE is
provided by the **DEVELOPER** at no cost and is intended for use as-is.

This page is used to inform any users of the application (the **USER**)
regarding policies for the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
Information when using the **SERVICE**.

**Information Collection and Use**

The **SERVICE** does not collect any sensitive or personally identifiable
information about the **USER**. The app does not use any third-party services
that may collect information used to identify the **USER**.

**Links to Other Sites**

The **SERVICE** may contain links to external sites. If the **USER** clicks on
a third-party link, the **USER** will be directed to that site. Note that these
external sites are not operated by the **DEVELOPER**. Therefore, it is strongly
advised that the **USER** reviews the Privacy Policy of these websites. The
**DEVELOPER** has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the
content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to
review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes
by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of February 2023.
